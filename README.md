# ðŸšš Courier Tracking API

A Java 21-based RESTful API that tracks courier geolocations and detects proximity to Migros stores. Built using Spring Boot, Maven, and Jacoco for test coverage. The API includes Swagger UI for testing and documentation.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

Track couriers' real-time geolocation and log when they enter a **100-meter** radius of predefined **Migros stores**. The system must:

- **Log entries** only if more than **1 minute** has passed since the last entry into the same store's radius.
- **Calculate total distance** traveled by each courier.
- Use at least **two design patterns**.

## ðŸ“Œ Endpoints

After Run CourierTrackingAppApplication
You can reach the swagger:
http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html

Try it out - endpoints

Firstly you should try post method
/v1/api/courier/location  
you can call this endpoint with several request
and then you can get total distance for specific couirer below endpoint
/v1/api/courier/{courierId}/total-distance

## ðŸš€ Features
